- 👋 Hi, I’m @n6bhu: I've been a radio amateur since March, 1979. Concurrent with my studies of amateur radio, and FCC license requirements I had also become interested in carrier-telephony, and some rather interesting workarounds (e.g. generating 2600 cycle test tones, et al). Telephony has changed considerably since then; Android and Asterisk are keeping my interests alive.
- 👀 I’m interested in Linux, Androids (and their innerds), and Asterisk.  (I have recently become less popular with telemarketers.)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more and more about my aforementioned interests (as I always seem to sink deeper and deeper into everything irrespective of whether or not I had planned it that way).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on all sorts of things; 'anyremote' has recently caught my curiosity.
- 📫 How to reach me: n6bhu@yahoo.com (I sift through all the spam regularly).
